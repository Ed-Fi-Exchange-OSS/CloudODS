| The Ed-Fi-Alliance has created a [Docker based deployment model](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/EDFITOOLS/Docker+Deployment) that is more actively maintained and should be considered for future deployments going forward. |

# Ed-Fi Cloud ODS Deploy Tools (Azure)

The Cloud ODS distribution includes scripts and Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
templates to aid in deploying a new copy of the ODS to Microsoft's Azure
platform. The goal of this effort is to reduce the amount of time and effort
needed to get a new instance of the ODS up and running.

## Documentation

* [Install Guide](docs/install-guide.md)
* [User's Guide](docs/user-guide-toc.md)

## Support

These scripts are provided as-is, but the Alliance welcomes feedback on
additions or changes that would make these resources more user friendly.
Feedback is best shared by raising a ticket on the Ed-Fi Tracker [Exchange
Contributions Project](https://tracker.ed-fi.org/projects/EXC/) using component
`azure`. We invite [pull
requests](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-X-Ods-Deploy-Azure) with
corrections and proposed additions.
